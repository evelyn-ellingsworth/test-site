      <h2>FCS at Lafayette</h2>
      <p>
         Lafayette provides many different opportunities to connect with Family
        and Consumer Sciences through classes, internships, and co-ops. By
        following one, or multiple, CTE pathways available at our school students

    <h3>Colleges  </h3>
    <p>
      If you are interested in continuing your family and consumer sciences education beyond high school, consider these in-state colleges.
    </p>
    <p>Going to college in state can reduce tuition costs and make housing easier. In addition all Kentucky students can earn KEES money throughout their academic career. This can later be used to pay for in state colleges.</p>
