        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Our Chapter</h2>
        <p>
          As a chapter, Lafayette High School FCCLA is dedicated to giving members the most opportunities possible and giving back to the community around us. Through participation in various conferences, STAR Events, and community service, we give members the ability to grow leadership skills, develop interpersonal relationships, and use their passions to help those around them.

        <h2>STAR Events</h2>
        <p>
          Students Taking Action with Recognition (STAR) Events are competitive events in which members, or teams, choose a project to complete within a school year. These projects can vary from fashion design, to food sciences, to public policy and outreach and students are encouraged to choose one that aligns with their interests or allows them to solve problems that they are passionate about. Participants in STAR Events compete against one another at regional, state, and national conferences.

        <h2>Community Service</h2>
        <p>
          At Lafayette, we are determined to give back to our school and community. Every semster, we choose a community service project to complete as a chapter. For the spring semster of the 2025-2026 school year, our Vice President of Community Service, Marisa Presley, choose to run a toy drive for the University of Kentucky Children's Hospital. With the help of students and teachers within our school, we were able to give over 200 toys.
