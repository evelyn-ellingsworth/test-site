      <h3>Why Should I Join?</h3>
      <p>
        Members of FCCLA get to participate in activities to increase their leadership skills in the classroom and beyond. STAR Events and Individual Programs provide students to explore their passions and help those around them. And conferences give opportunities to network and make friends across your region, state, and even the nation.

        We have full chapter meetings on the last Wednesday or Thursday of every month. Attendance is not required but it is suggested. If you are a STAR Events competitor, then there are required meetings on Wednesday and Thursday mornings every week. You are only required to go to one a week.

      </p>
      <h3> Collaborations With Other Clubs </h3>
      <p>This year we have worked with several other clubs on community service projects. This makes us more visible as a club and shows others who are already interested in helping their community what they could do in FCCLA.
      </p>
      <h3>Open House </h3>
      <p>Every year our school does an eighth grade open house. Our chapter joins in with a booth in the clubs section to introduce Lafayette FCCLA to incoming freshmen.
