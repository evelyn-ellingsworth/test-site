  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div class = "para-1">
  <p>As a chapter, we created our program of work with the goal of giving members as many opportunities as possible while also giving back to the community around us. We wanted to make STAR Events as accessible as possible to members so we created specific meetings to focus on STAR Events. Through this commitment we met the first goal of FCCLA, to provide opportunities for personal development and preparation of adult life, and the eighth goal, to promote Family and Consumer Sciences and related occupations.</p>

  <div class = "para-2">
  <p>Our goal this year was to have a large community service project each semester. This allows members to give back to our community and learn about themselves in the process. This relates to purpose 4, to encourage individual and group involvement in helping achieve global cooperation and harmony, and purpose six, to provide opportunities for making decisions and for assuming responsibilities.
